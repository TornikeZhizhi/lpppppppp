				<p> Over the period of its existence, LPA handled numerous projects related to banking and other nancial institutions. Starting from issuing comprehensive
				guidelines for registration and operation of commercial banks in Georgia, our attorneys have dealt with actual registration process of commercial banks and
				acquisition of banking licenses. During their practice, LPA lawyers have conducted complete due diligence studies of nancial institutions, including regulatory
				and environmental aspects, which goes beyond the standard due diligence scope for regular enterprises.</p>
				<p>Further to special requests of potential investors in banking sector, we have examined and prepared legal opinions and respective recommendations
				assessing investment related risks.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, for over three years, LPA has been managing entire loan portfolio of several microfinance institutions, capturing title due diligences of collaterals,
				preparation of respective loan and mortgage/pledge agreements and related documents, dealing with dispute settlements/resolution and handling
				enforcement issues, when necessary.</p>
				<p>Apart from the pure banking related work, we have dealt with extremely complex nancial and securitization projects, involving cross border transactions
                and debt investments, building subordinated and convertible loan and collateral structures for dierent projects.</p>
				<p>In 2012, LPA has greatly contributed to the World Bank and IFC Survey on Doing Business in Georgia and has been acknowledged and gratied by
				the respective team working on the stated Project.</p>
